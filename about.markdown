My name is Albert Gil Escura, and I'm currently working as a engineer and working on Tyris Software, but worked in iOS development for the last 10 years. First, with Objective-C, then with Swift and now SwiftUI plus The Composable Architecture by Pointfree. I also did Computer Science with a master in geospatial technologies and a master in agile methods, including graduate school.

Here, some meetups I did in the past.
