Hello, world!

I'm going to start a new blog. Yeah, definitely yes. My idea is to write down all my thoughts relating to swift language and Apple ecosystem but, maybe, add all new topics like machine learning or interesting technologies.

I had been wanting to start a new blog for a while. I'm so happy with the finished resultâ€“ I really hope you like it too.

Can't wait to start writing down!
